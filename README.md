Genetic algorithms emulate natural selection, where the most suitable individuals in a population reproduce, passing on their genetic traits. The fitness of individuals depends on their performance, such as reaching a target. Genetic algorithms iteratively optimize solutions by guiding evolution toward greater efficiency.
